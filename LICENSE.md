You agree to pay a royalty equal to 1% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to each Product, 
regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal entity, as follows:
     
     a.  Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any and all media, 
         including but not limited to digital and retail;
     b.  Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, 
         downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, 
         or exchange of content created by end users for use with a Product, or redemption of 
         virtual currency, either within a Product or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;
     c.  Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with Product access 
         or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, 
         your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, 
         but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);
     d.  Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;
     e.  Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise); and
     f.  Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).
